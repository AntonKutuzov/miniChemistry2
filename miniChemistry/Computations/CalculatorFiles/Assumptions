# The format is the following:
# 1) Each assumption has a name (STP, NTP, etc). The name is given on a separate line and always starts with the
# exclamation mark "!". No spaces before the symbols are allowed. The short names (3 letters) can be followed by a full
# name given after a colon. These names are stripped for spaces, so can contain them on either side.
#
# next the variables and their values for the assumption come. The keyword "variable" indicates that this string will
# be split and written as a Datum into the LinearIterator class' instance. The "compute" keyword mean that the
# variable will be calculated right after the assumption is applied (useful for constants that depend on other constants,
# like V0 (molar volume of gases).
# "assume" means that while computing all the "compute" variables, the following variables will be set, but then deleted.
#
# Large numbers are indicated using the E-notation, for example 6.02*10**23 should be written as 6.02E23, because only
# this form can be interpreted correctly by the built-in float() function.
#
# Finally, the "#" sign indicates comments and is ignored by the code. NOTE that triple quotation marks do not work
# here! Only the "#" sign!
