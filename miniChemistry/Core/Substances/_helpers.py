    The function is intended to select an appropriate charge for an element that will be then converted into an ion.
    Possible charges of an ion consisting of the given chemical element are limited to its oxidation states (a tuple
    inside the pt.Element class). The way the function chooses the charge is not valid from chemical point of view,
    but rather is based on empirical observations that most of the common chemical reactions met in school go up to
    the largest possible oxidation state (this is the default situation when "choose_largest_charge" is set to True).

    However, in some cases it is also needed to have another charge, not the largest one. In this case the function
    chooses the opposite â€“ the lowest charge.

    The problem, of course, is that the function cannot choose from the middle oxidation states. If such a particle is
    required, the charge of the particle must be set by hand.
