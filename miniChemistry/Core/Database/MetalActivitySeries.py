BACKGROUND FROM CHEMISTRY
The metal activity series is a real series (i.e. it really is used in school chemistry) that shows metal activity
relative to hydrogen. It originates from the row of electric potentials, but that's not important right now. Instead,
there are some other empirical rules detected by the author of this package that are quite rough, but they are quite
enough for purposes of miniChemistry module.

The metal activity series looks literally like a series of metals (represented by their symbols), for example, a very
short version of the series will look like this

K Na Ca Al Zn Cr Fe Ni H Cu Ag Au
(in the order of decreasing activity, i.e. K is the most active, and Au is the least)

As you can see, there are two important things to mention. First, way not all metals are present in the series, and in
this package this is a problem as it does not restrict the user to several most well-known (in school) metals. Second,
in the METAL activity series, there is a hydrogen, which is not a metal (you can check it in 'ptable.py' if you want).

The answer/solution to these problems are the following:
1) The class MetalActivitySeries has a method called estimate() which estimates activity of a given metal by comparing
the metal passed as a parameter to the metals inside the series (although this seems like a loop, it is not. This
function uses the patterns found by the author. More on them in the function's description).
2) As you may know from school chemistry, (or as you could have guessed from the beginning of this text), hydrogen
is present in the series to see whether a metal is more active than hydrogen or less active. This becomes very
important when writing chemical reactions of metals and acids, as in these reactions metal always (tends to) replace
hydrogen inside an acid. Hence, if the metal is more active than hydrogen, it can replace it in the acid, if it is not,
then it can't. Moreover, more active metals will replace less active metals in salts. However, this is already basics of
school chemistry, so we won't go deep into them here.


IMPLEMENTATION
The MetalActivitySeries is implemented as a class, containing the series and providing some methods for work with it.
The most important application of the series, as you could have guessed, is comparing activity of different methods to
predict outcomes of chemical reactions. Thus, the class has a method called

compare(el1: pt.Element, el2: pt.Element, return_active: bool = True) -> pt.Element

It takes two elements (they must be metals) and returns either of them depending on the "return_active" parameter's
value. The other two methods are just a pre-set compare() method, namely

more_active(el1: pt.Element, el2: pt.Element) -> pt.Element     (return_active = True)
more_inert(el1: pt.Element, el2: pt.Element) -> pt.Element      (return_active = False)

Both return respective element.

The class also has a method that returns activity itself as a string, which is one of the four given below
1) active
2) middle active
3) inactive
4) unknown

activity(element: pt.Element) -> str

The class also has a method called estimate(element: pt.Element) -> pt.Element

which estimates activity of a metal that is not in the series by returning an element that IS present in the series
(may be needed if two metals are compared to each other, and one or both are not in the series). The details of the
decision-making mechanism is given in the description of the method.

All the other methods are explain in the class description.

        MECHANISM
        The author of the package noted that from the most active metals up to (not including) the inactive ones,
        activity of a metal strongly correlates with its REN. Moreover, all the exceptions (not the inactive metals)
        can be easily explained. Thus, the method looks at the REN of the parameter's element and returns the element
        from the series that has the closest REN to it.

        """
        Estimates activity of an element by comparing its properties to the properties of the elements in the series.
        The logic for the choice is the following: the active metals generally obey the correlation between REN and
        activity, however there are two exceptions that fit well into an assumption that in this group of metals also
        the number of electrons (on the outer shell) plays significant role. Thus, to account for this, the analogies
        for passed metals are chosen only from the group the metals belongs to.

        For the middle active metals the rule with REN works without exceptions (or at least the author didn't see them),
        which is enough for this package. The only problems begin at the very end of middle active section, where
        inactive metals start.

        For inactive metals there's no one significant correlation between any property and activity, and thus (also
        knowing that inactive metals don't react much, which means we don't care about their activity so much) the
        algorithm is just returning the closest metal present in the table: for groups 1B and 2B the method returns
        silver (Ag), for group 8B â€“ platinum (Pt), for anything else â€“ tungsten (W).

        NOTE: to get more you can always print all the elements in the series together with their REN values.
