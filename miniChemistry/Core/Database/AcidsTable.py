"""
In chemistry, there are pairs of substances based on their chemical behaviour. Thus, in chemistry we have acids bound to
acidic oxides and acid rests, and bases bound to their cations and basic oxides.

ACIDS
An acid in school chemistry is a molecule that possesses a proton (H(+) ion) and can easily give it away in chemical
reactions. In miniChemistry then, an acid as any molecule that has H(+) as its cation. This is not entirely correct,
as we can also define, say, ammonia as an acid then, but for a majority of school chemistry molecules it works.
NOTE FOR CHEMISTS: just in case it wasn't clear. In this package the property of easily detaching a proton is omitted,
so only possession is enough to call a molecule an acid.

Each acid consists of a cation (proton) and anion (they are different). The anion is called an "acid rest", because this
is what is left when an acid looses a proton. Moreover, if an element forming an acid is taken (sulfur for sulfuric acid,
phosphorus for phosphoric acid, etc.), and an oxide is formed with the same oxidation state as the element has in the
acid (see examples below), the formed oxide is called an acidic oxide. One of its important (also to this package)
properties is that when reacting with water, it forms a corresponding acid.

EXAMPLES
name        acid        acid forming element        acid rest           acidic oxide
––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
sulfuric    H2SO4           S   (sulfur)            SO4(-2)                 SO3
phosphoric  H3PO4           P   (phosphorus)        PO4(-3)                 P2O5
carbonic    H2CO3           C   (carbon)            CO3(-2)                 CO2

If you look at the oxidation state of the acid-forming element in both acid and the corresponding oxide, you will
see that it is the same.
NOTE: we don't discuss here how to calculate oxidation states of elements in molecules, because this is a basic knowledge
obtained from school chemistry. And this text is primarily documentation of the Python code, not chemistry textbook.

class AcidsTable:
    """
    Given the information above, the class stores three types of substances – acids, acid rests (ions), and
    acidic oxides. The data are read from a text file and converted into instances of Molecule and Ion. This is done
    so that it is easy to add new acids to the file without working with the actual code.

    The class has three respective methods:
    acid() -> Molecule
    acid_rest() -> Ion
    acidic_oxide() -> Molecule

    Each takes in a Molecule or Ion instance and returns corresponding acid/acid rest/acidic oxide. There are also
    methods used to create these substances from their formulas. These methods are private.

    To add a new acid to the file, do the following
    1) Take a look at the method used to convert the acid rest formula to the instance of Ion (_convert_acid_rests).
    The acid should not cause any exceptions there (in case of doubt, this can always be checked experimentally)
    2) Open the AcidCompatibilityTable.txt and add there the following text, replacing the brackets by respective
    molecules/ion: <acid rest in the conventional form>:<acid-forming element as an ion in the conventional form>.
    The conventional form of writing ions in this module is writing their formula and placing their charge in
    parentheses, e.g. O(-2) or H(1). Note that there's no plus sign!
    3) In case if the acid does not have an acidic oxide, e.g. HF, write "None" (exactly like here)
    4) Close the file and test if the code works
    NOTE: no spaces are needed between the ions or colon. Leave an empty line at the end of the file.
