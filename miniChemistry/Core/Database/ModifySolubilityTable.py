"""
Filling in the solubility table by hand would take a lot of time. Also, in the case of a mistake it would be required
to erase it and write the data again. A much more convenient and fast way is to automate this process by using common
patterns from chemistry.

The most frequently used substances which do not follow any specific pattern are given in SolubilityTable.xlsx file and
are read from there by pandas package. Some less common substances (also ions) are listed here in the code.

Since in miniChemistry solubility table also plays an important role of ions database, all possible ions are added
based on their oxidation states. In this case possible cations are bound to oxygen which always have an oxidation state
of -2 (except for rare cases that are not discussed here). In the case of anions, they are bound to hydrogen, which
always have an oxidation state of +1 (again, except for some specific cases, which are not discussed here).

IMPORTANT PATTERNS USED
- all nitrates are soluble (nitrate = anions is NO3(-))
- all sodium compounds are soluble (cation = Na(+))
- all acids are soluble except for H2SiO3 (acid = cation is H(+))
- most nonmetal oxides are gases and hence have undefined solubility* (solubility="ND")

* NOTE: Gases of course also have solubility in water, however their solubilities differ so much from solubilities of
bases, acids and salts that they are not included in solubility table. In reality, solubilities of gases are usually
obtained from solubility curves. In this module the oxides are added to add the anions, i.e. to make the table a
database. Hence, their solubility is just set to ND (no data).

    Ions based on the oxidation states of the elements can, indeed, be created only for single-element ions that consist
    of the chosen element. So, the ions created for each element will be ions with all possible non-zero oxidation states of

    -2, 0, 2, 4, 6
    removing zero we get a list of ions
