"""
In some cases, where the common mechanisms (which means, also those that are described in this module) predict the
outcome, the products might not form, or might react back to reagents. Iin both cases (in this module, not in
chemistry) we would say that the reaction will not proceed.

To estimate whether the reaction products can be formed, several checks are imposed on the reagents or the products. There
are three tests that in this module are called "reaction restrictions". Namely, those are

- Weak electrolyte restriction. There is a rule in chemistry that the ion exchange reaction (simple exchange in this
module) proceeds only if a weak electrolyte is formed. Namely, those usually are either water, or gas, or precipitate
(insoluble substance).

- Metal strength restriction. Another rule, which follows from the metal activity series, is that only the metals that
are more active than hydrogen, can react with acids. Another formulation (more general) is that more active metal tends
to replace less active in a molecule (salt or acid). Hence, it has to be checked that the metal to be placed is more
active than the metal in the molecule.

- Metal and water restriction. This is an exception to the previous rule. In some cases water can be treated as a weak
acid. That means, it can also react with metals, forming the same products as real acids do. However, due to low strength
of water as an acid, it only reacts with active metals. Hence, if there's a reaction of water with metal, it has to be
checked that the metal is among active metals.

Since those are tests, that indicate whether a reaction will proceed, they return a boolean value with True for "yes"
and False for "no". The signatures are the following:

weak_electrolyte_restriction(*products: Union[Simple, Molecule], raise_exception: bool = False) -> bool
metal_activity_restriction(*products: Union[Simple, Molecule], raise_exception: bool = False) -> bool
metal_and_water_restriction(sub: [Simple, Molecule], metal: [Simple, Molecule], raise_exception: bool = False) -> bool

NOTE: some reactions do not need restrictions and always proceed.
