"""
Complex mechanisms handle the cases where simple mechanisms cannot succeed. Namely, those are reactions of basic and
acidic oxides, AND decomposition reactions of three-element molecules.

NOTE FOR CHEMISTS: The mechanisms are called "complex" because each of them uses one of the simple mechanisms. The
complex mechanisms have nothing to do with complex substances (like K[Al(OH)4]).


COMPLEX DECOMPOSITION
Complex_decomposition mechanism has to handle the following reactions:
- decomposition of 3-element salts      | Na2SO3 -> Na2O + SO2  | K3PO4 -> K2O + P2O5   |
- decomposition of oxoacids             | H2SO4 -> H2O + SO3    | H2CO3 -> H2O + CO2    |
- decomposition of bases                | NaOH -> Na2O + H2O    | Zn(OH)2 -> ZnO + H2O  |

NOTE: oxoacids are the acids that contain oxygen, e.g. H2SO4, but not HCl.

From chemical point of view, simple decomposition handles the opposite reaction of what the first case of complex
neutralization does. Looking carefully, you can see that in all three cases a 3-element molecule decomposes into two
2-element molecules, namely, always oxides.

Since simple decomposition handles only decomposition of 2-element molecules, these cases had to  be handled separately.
(And there's indeed a reason for why it wasn't convenient to join them all in one method).


COMPLEX ADDITION
Complex addition mechanism has to handle the following reactions:
- addition of basic/acidic oxide to water       | Na2O + H2O -> NaOH | SO3 + H2O -> H2SO4
- reaction of acidic and basic oxides           | Na2O + SO3 -> Na2SO4

It can be easily seen that in the first case the product is just an acid/base corresponding to the oxide (which,
in fact, is a property of these oxides). In the second case the product is equal to the product of a simple
exchange reaction between the respective acid and base.


COMPLEX NEUTRALIZATION
Complex_neutralization mechanism has to handle the following reactions:
- basic oxide + acidic oxide    | Na2O + SO2 -> Na2SO3  | ZnO + P2O5 -> Zn3(PO4)2 (redirected to complex addition)
- basic oxide + acid            | Na2O + H2SO4 -> Na2SO4 + H2O
- base + acidic oxide           | Ba(OH)2 + CO2 -> BaCO3 + H2O
- (base + acid) is considered by the simple_exchange mechanism

Complex neutralization can be thought of as an extension of the conventional neutralization reaction – acid + base.
From chemical point of view, these reactions are very similar – in all four (given above) a substance with basic
nature (base, basic oxide) reacts with a substance with acidic nature (acid, acidic oxide).

A careful look at the substances will show that the products of the three reactions follow the logic of simple exchange
when done with neutralization. Acid + base -> salt + water. So, to implement the mechanisms it is enough to run a
simple exchange reaction between the corresponding acid and/or base and return the products. With some corrections,
this approach works.

NOTE: acidic oxide + basic oxide is also available in complex neutralization reaction to maintain logical
consistency: in fact this reaction falls equally well to both kinds of reactions, so it is also available in both.
