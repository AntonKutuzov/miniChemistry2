"""
Simple mechanisms are four types of reactions defined within this Python package. The reaction types described copy the
common reaction classification by the number of reacting substances. Although, here the primary definition of the
reaction type is not the number of reacting substances, but rather their number AND type. Subsequently,

simple_addition(sub1: Simple, sub2: Simple) -> Molecule
simple_decomposition(sub: Molecule) -> Tuple[Simple, Simple]
simple_substitution(sub1: Union[Simple, Molecule], sub2: Union[Simple, Molecule]) -> Tuple[Simple, Molecule]
simple_exchange(sub1: Molecule, sub2: Molecule) -> Tuple[Molecule, Molecule]

NOTE: signature of the simple_addition() reaction is different from the given here. Here the signatures are simplified
to demonstrate what defines a reaction within the set classification.
